    <h1>Proxy</h1>
    <h3><em>Be There, from Anywhere</em></h3>

    <h2><em>What is Proxy?</em></h2>
    <p><strong>Imagine stepping into another place, another body, without leaving your home.</strong></p>
    <p>Proxy combines advancements in high-speed internet, virtual reality, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and
        robotics to create a new way of interacting with the physical world. You will be able to pilot physical robots
        and vehicles, known as a Proxy, in the real world, from anywhere on the planet, for an affordable price.</p>
    <p>Your first Proxy will connect you to the physical world, just as the internet connects you to the digital world.
        You can inhabit a physical device from anywhere, breaking down barriers and opening up infinite possibilities.
        By applying technological advancements in several fields, we aim to create an immersive and human experience,
        both for the person using the Proxy and those interacting with the Proxy device in the physical world.</p>
    <p>We are building the future of interaction: Proxy will bridge the gap between the physical and digital world.</p>

    <h2><em>How would I use Proxy?</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Visit Loved Ones</em>: Easily attend birthdays, holidays, and impromptu get-togethers without the hassle
            and expense of travel.</li>
        <li><em>Remote Work</em>: Attend meetings, give presentations, and collaborate with colleagues as if in the same
            room.</li>
        <li><em>Accessible Experiences</em>: Explore museums, attend concerts, or visit new cities from the comfort of
            your home.</li>
        <li><em>Authentic Interactions</em>: Foster genuine connections with people through physical presence, beyond
            what's possible online.</li>
        <li><em>Immersive Learning</em>: Attend classes and workshops with a heightened sense of presence, engaging with
            instructors and peers.</li>
        <li><em>Outsource Errands</em>: Free up time by having someone else remotely handle your errands and chores.
        </li>
        <li><em>Enhance Mobility</em>: Participate in physical events and activities, even with mobility issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Proxy will empower you to be anywhere, anytime: you will experience the world like never before.</p>

    <h2><em>Is Proxy feasible?</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The technology is ready:</strong> Advancements in VR, robotics, and AI have reached a point where
            Proxy is now feasible and affordable.</li>
        <li><strong>The need is real:</strong> There is a growing demand for ways to bridge the physical and digital
            world, especially in post-pandemic society.</li>
        <li><strong>The team is passionate and determined:</strong> We are a diverse group of individuals with expertise
            in various fields, all driven by the potential of Proxy.</li>
        <li><strong>We are committed to open source:</strong> We believe in collaboration and community involvement,
            which is why we are building Proxy with the same open-source mindset.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>State-of-the-art AI expands what we can do by many magnitudes, allowing us to punch above our weight and deliver
        on our ambitious goals, while minimizing bureaucracy and complexity.</p>

    <h2><em>Who is working on Proxy, and can I get involved?</em></h2>
    <p>Our small, focused team is committed to achieving more with less. We are taking a realistic and grounded approach to
    development, prioritizing an interactive demo by Summer 2024. With plans measured in years and execution measured in weeks, 
    we have already begun the work to bring Proxy to life.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We are not seeking investments before our first demo, but support via no-obligation grants is welcome
            (<a href="mailto:funding@what-is-proxy.com">contact us</a>).</li>
