<body>
    <h1>PROXY</h1>
    <p><em>Be There, from Anywhere</em></p>

    <h1><em>What is PROXY?</em></h1>
    <p><strong>Imagine stepping into another place, another body, without leaving your home.</strong></p>
    <p>PROXY combines advancements in high-speed internet, virtual reality, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and
        robotics to create a new way of interacting with the physical world. You will be able to pilot physical robots
        and vehicles, known as a Proxy, in the real world, from anywhere on the planet, for an affordable price.</p>
    <p>Your first Proxy will connect you to the physical world, just as the internet connects you to the digital world.
        You can inhabit a physical device from anywhere, breaking down barriers and opening up infinite possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>By applying technological advancements in several fields, we aim to create an immersive and human experience,
        both for the person using the Proxy and those interacting with the Proxy device in the physical world.</p>
    <p>We are building the future of interaction.</p>
    <p>Proxy will bridge the gap between the physical and digital world.</p>

    <h1><em>Why would I use Proxy?</em></h1>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Visit Loved Ones</em>: Easily attend birthdays, holidays, and impromptu get-togethers without the hassle
            and expense of travel.</li>
        <li><em>Remote Work</em>: Attend meetings, give presentations, and collaborate with colleagues as if in the same
            room.</li>
        <li><em>Accessible Experiences</em>: Explore museums, attend concerts, or visit new cities from the comfort of
            your home.</li>
        <li><em>Authentic Interactions</em>: Foster genuine connections with people through physical presence, beyond
            what's possible online.</li>
        <li><em>Immersive Learning</em>: Attend classes and workshops with a heightened sense of presence, engaging with
            instructors and peers.</li>
        <li><em>Outsource Errands</em>: Free up time by having someone else remotely handle your errands and chores.
        </li>
        <li><em>Enhance Mobility</em>: Participate in physical events and activities, even with mobility issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Proxy will empower you to be anywhere, anytime.</p>
    <p>You will experience the world like never before.</p>

    <h1><em>Will Proxy work?</em></h1>
    <p>We believe have the potential to make this happen:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The technology is ready:</strong> Advancements in VR, robotics, and AI have reached a point where
            Proxy is now feasible and affordable.</li>
        <li><strong>The need is real:</strong> There is a growing demand for ways to bridge the physical and digital
            worlds, especially in a post-pandemic society.</li>
        <li><strong>The team is passionate and determined:</strong> We are a diverse group of individuals with expertise
            in various fields, all driven by the potential of PROXY.</li>
        <li><strong>We are committed to open source:</strong> We believe in collaboration and community involvement,
            which is why we are building Proxy with the same open-source mindset.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are taking a realistic and grounded approach to development, with a focus on delivering a working demo by
        Summer 2024. We are confident that there is a very real path to bringing PROXY to life; and work has already
        begun to make this happen.</p>

    <h1><em>Who is working on PROXY, and can I get involved?</em></h1>
    <p>We are a small team, focused on doing more with less.</p>
    <p>We are not seeking investments before our first demo.</p>
