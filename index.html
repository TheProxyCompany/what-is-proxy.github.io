    <h1>PROXY</h1>
    <h3><em>Be There, from Anywhere</em></h3>

    <h2><em>What is PROXY?</em></h2>
    <p><strong>Imagine stepping into another place, another body, without leaving your home.</strong></p>
    <p>PROXY combines advancements in high-speed internet, virtual reality, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and
        robotics to create a new way of interacting with the physical world. <br>You will be able to pilot physical robots and vehicles, 
        known as a Proxy, in the real world, from anywhere on the planet, for an affordable price.</p>
    <p>Your first Proxy will connect you to the physical world, just as the internet connects you to the digital world.
        You can inhabit a physical device from anywhere,<br>breaking down barriers and opening up infinite possibilities.
        By applying technological advancements in several fields, we aim to create an immersive and human experience,
        <br>both for the person using the Proxy and those interacting with the Proxy device in the physical world.</p>
    <p>We are building the future of interaction: PROXY will bridge the gap between the physical and digital world.</p>

    <h2><em>Why would I use Proxy?</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Visit Loved Ones</em>: Easily attend birthdays, holidays, and impromptu get-togethers without the hassle
            and expense of travel.</li>
        <li><em>Remote Work</em>: Attend meetings, give presentations, and collaborate with colleagues as if in the same
            room.</li>
        <li><em>Accessible Experiences</em>: Explore museums, attend concerts, or visit new cities from the comfort of
            your home.</li>
        <li><em>Authentic Interactions</em>: Foster genuine connections with people through physical presence, beyond
            what's possible online.</li>
        <li><em>Immersive Learning</em>: Attend classes and workshops with a heightened sense of presence, engaging with
            instructors and peers.</li>
        <li><em>Outsource Errands</em>: Free up time by having someone else remotely handle your errands and chores.
        </li>
        <li><em>Enhance Mobility</em>: Participate in physical events and activities, even with mobility issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>PROXY will empower you to be anywhere, anytime: you will experience the world like never before.</p>

    <h2><em>Will PROXY work?</em></h2>
    <p>We have the potential to make this happen:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The technology is ready:</strong> Advancements in VR, robotics, and AI have reached a point where
            PROXY is now feasible and affordable.</li>
        <li><strong>The need is real:</strong> There is a growing demand for ways to bridge the physical and digital
            world, especially in post-pandemic society.</li>
        <li><strong>The team is passionate and determined:</strong> We are a diverse group of individuals with expertise
            in various fields, all driven by the potential of PROXY.</li>
        <li><strong>We are committed to open source:</strong> We believe in collaboration and community involvement,
            which is why we are building PROXY with the same open-source mindset.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are taking a realistic and grounded approach to development, with a focus on delivering a working demo by
        Summer 2024. 
    <br>We are confident that there is a very real path to bringing PROXY to life; and work has already
        begun to make this happen.</p>
